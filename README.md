# Dice
A 2d web app that throws a d20 (the best kind of dice). It's more of an experiment
with [ThreeJs][threejs] and [Cannon.js][cannonjs] rather than a serious project.
Feel free to check out the [demo][demo].

## How to install
You need [bower][bower] to install the dependencies. If you don't have it, just
follow the instructions on their website.

To install the dependencies run `bower update`

[threejs]: http://threejs.org/
[cannonjs]: http://www.cannonjs.org/
[bower]: http://bower.io/

[demo]: http://perchema.tk/dice/
